Vlachos Group Additivity (VGA)
==============================
  
The Vlachos Group Additivity (VGA) python library and packages is deprecated and has been renamed Python Group Addivity (pGrAdd). The new Github repository can be found at https://github.com/VlachosGroup/PythonGroupAdditivity/ and the new version is named pGrAdd on pypi.org. pGrAdd v1.3.6 is identical to VGA v1.3.6. All future development will occur only on pGrAdd.
